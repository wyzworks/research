### PatentNetwork 
* I uploaded sample code works from my recent research project, submitted to Journal Technological Forecasting and Social Change. 
* The patent data from the US and South Korea was analyzed to investigate industrial dynamics in accordance with technology emergence and policy implementation. 
* For QAP analysis, I imported library from Lisette Espin https://github.com/lisette-espin/mrqap-python/blob/p3/libs/qap.py , and edited for my research. The imported codes are organized in ./PatentNetwork/libs folder
### Macroeconomics 
* This folder was for the submission of my last term-project on macroeconomics course. 
* Our team analyzed macroeconomic aggregates with MATLAB, using hpfilter.
### NTIS
* This folder is for my side-project, utilizing South Korean governmental funding dataset. 
* The network analysis was applied to interpret the data, figuring dynamics of industrial networks.
